**âš  Archived**: Batched Entity Rendering is a component of the [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris) shader mod. This mod was just a temporary place to test out a rewritten version of the optimization before integrating it back into Iris. This mod is very much out of date and does not support modern versions of Minecraft, please see Iris instead.

# Batched Entity Rendering

A simple mod to batch together many entities into a few draw calls for increased performance in scenarios with many
entities present.

This mod was originally incorporated into Iris, but it has been temporarily split off in order to facilitate debugging
issues with the code.
